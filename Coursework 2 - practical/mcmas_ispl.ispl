Formulae 
    -- AF sunk;             -- There exists a path where the submarine eventually sinks
    -- AG (surface or !surface); -- Always either on surface or not on surface
    -- AF surface and !open and !sunk; -- there is a path where its on the surface and has not sunk nor opened the hatch
    -- AG surface -> EF !surface; -- On all paths if surface is true then exists a path in which we can turn it false.
    -- AG !open -> EF open; -- On all paths if open is false then exists a path in which we can turn it true.
    -- EF (EG (!surface and !sunk)); -- There is a path where from some future state, there is a path where in every state the submarine is not on the surface but is also not sunk.
    AG !open; -- On all paths globally the hatch is never open.
    AF sunk; -- On all paths at some point in the future the submarine is sunk.
    EF (sunk -> (EF !sunk)); -- There is a path where at some point the submarine is sunk and from there there is a path where at some point in the future it is not sunk.
    AX (AX !sunk); -- On all paths in the next state it holds that on all paths in the next state the submarine is not sunk.
